title: "Tapir modules"
excerpt: "Index of generic modules available in NPM"
---
Depending on your bundle's purpose, you may be able to use or extend one of the generic Tapir modules available in npm rather than writing something new from scratch. While there are simple sources, transforms, and destinations available within the Tapir framework itself, as well as helpers and utilities for you to use in writing your own, these are more complex and production-ready:
