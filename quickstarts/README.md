The goal of the Tapir bundle framework is to make it as simple as possible to develop new, custom tiles to be used on the Vizia platform. A [toolkit of modules](../tapir-modules/) already exists that you can combine, with or without your own custom logic, to create a tile with the data you want to see in Vizia, organized the way you want to display it. These quickstarts exist to let you create a working bundle you can then use as a template, swapping out whatever pieces you need to.
