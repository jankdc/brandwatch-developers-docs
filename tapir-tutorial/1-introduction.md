In this tutorial we will create two applications that display transaction data from Monzo bank.

We will create:

1. An app that displays cumulative daily spending
2. An app that shows daily spending, grouped by spending category
We will discuss how best to architect an app with an eye on code reuse, as well as how to create unit and integration tests for your apps.
