allows you to display Brandwatch data in a variety of ways, but you can extend it by adding other data sources, displays, and ways of transforming that data. Tapir is a framework to help you create custom Vizia apps, or bundles, from these building blocks. \nWhat is Tapir?\nLearn to use Tapir\n"},"tapir-api/tapir-overview.html":{"url":"tapir-api/tapir-overview.html","title":"Tapir API","keywords":"","body":"Before diving into coding with Tapir, it's helpful to understand what the framework is meant to help you do. A bundle/app allows you to combine a data source or sources, transformations, and/or a destination where the data will be output. The bundle itself is a kind of controller overseeing the composition of those pieces and packaging the whole process up to be used within Vizia. Tapir itself includes a number of off the shelf utilities from each of the three areas of concern (sources, transforms, and destinations), but it also includes more abstract modules you can use as the basis for custom code. To see what a bundle looks like with a bare minimum of custom code, have a look at the CSV example in Tapir.\nTo do something more powerful, you can use custom components in combination with the tools already available in Vizia, or to combine existing tools in a custom configuration. All three types of components are written as separate modules which will be dependencies of your main bundle module. For a bundle with custom modules you've written for each area of concern, a file structure might look like this:\n/custom-bundle\n |-/destination\n    |-/templates\n       |-template.hbs\n    |-destination-module.js\n    |-destination.css\n |-/transforms\n    |-date-transform-module.js\n    |-text-transform-module.js\n |-bundle.js\n |-source-module.js\nDependency management is even more straight-forward than that. As mentioned, bundles require the other pieces as dependencies. For most of the individual components, it's likely that you'll get some advantage from requiring the Tapir modules and extending their functionality. However, because functionality is piped together, those dependencies shouldn't need to go more than one level deep for most scenarios and modules can remain lightweight. Sources and transforms can easily be stand-alone modules because their work is fairly specific (fetching data from one place or transforming it in a single way, respectively). Destinations are more likely to be composed of other code in addition to the destination module itself if they require display resources such as HTML or CSS.\nTapir is relatively light on convention, but there are a few important things to note about each of these modules to make them work together. One thing that applies to all of them is the way they're composed; they're chained together in the bundle in the order source → transform[s] → destination. The bundle pulls all the pieces together with a series of calls to its use method, which it inherits as an instance of a Tapir bundle. It might look like this:\nvar custom_bundle = tapir();\ncustom_bundle.use( source_module )\n  .use( split() )\n  .use( date_transform() )\n  .use( text_transform() )\n  .use( destination_module );\nmodule.exports = custom_bundle;\nWhether use is passed a variable name or function call depends on the structure of the module being called. If the module exports a function named create you can reference it with .use( module_name ) and the framework will do the rest. You'd use create if you wanted to pass in the config object when the module was used. Otherwise, you can name your functions anything you like, export what you like, and pass in whatever arguments you need directly from the bundle.\nAlthough data sources can be anything you like, Tapir contains utilities for the most common, arrays and XHRs. Using the array or http sources, you can create a data source with relatively little code. If your data needs further transformation (for example, extracting it from a response object), you can handle that within your source or further down the chain.\nTransform modules are perhaps the most portable piece of a bundle, so they're slightly more likely to exist as functions that act on any data they receive in an agnostic way, not looking for certain external config properties. Because of how bundles are chained together, they're likely to contain something resembling the following pattern (which will quickly become familiar):\nmodule.exports = function() { return transform( function(data) {...} )};\nWhen the framework calls your transform it will pass its data as it currently exists (so any previous transforms will have been applied).\nBecause they're the end of our chain of functionality, destinations can be more complicated. If you require the destination utility module as a dependency, you can call that to get a reference to its fetchData method. Calling fetchData allows you to backtrack all the way to the beginning of the chain with requesting code–beginning with your rendering code in the destination–calling back to the previous step once it's ready to process it. Separating your code into callbacks will work differently depending on what you'd like your destination to do, so it's best to start with tutorial code and then begin to experiment.\nOnce you begin to explore coding a more complex bundle you may begin to wonder about one more important Tapir convention, the pattern of returning function calls mentioned above. You might have expected that functions would return variables or a framework object. Those latter conventions would work well for creating a tidy chain with static data, but passing callbacks is something we do to support working with streaming data. This way, if we receive additional data from our source it's piped through all the same functionality as the data we had already and then added to our destination.\n"},"tapir-api/getting-started.html":{"url":"tapir-api/getting-started.html","title":"Getting Started with Tapir","keywords":"","body":"Install tapir via npm\nnpm install --save vizia/tapir#v3.x\n\nMake a simple bundle\nconst tapir = require('@vizia/tapir')\nconst log = require('@vizia/tapir/destinations/log')\n\nconst bundle = tapir()\n\nconst people = [\n  {\n    name: 'donny'\n  },\n  {\n    name: 'donson'\n  }\n]\n\nbundle.source(people)\n\nbundle.use(person => person.name)\n\nbundle.use(log)\n\nmodule.exports = bundle\n\n"},"tapir-api/package-json.html":{"url":"tapir-api/package-json.html","title":"Example package.json","keywords":"","body":"For your first bundle, it may be easier to start by adding a package.json file and running npm install, rather than installing all the dependencies you may need manually.

Let's look at what the finished source will look like, and then break it down and explain how it fits together.\n'use strict';\n\nvar http = require('@vizia/tapir/sources/http');\nvar json = require('@vizia/tapir/transforms/json');\nvar MONDO_API_URL = 'https://api.getmondo.co.uk';\n\nfunction create(config) {\n    // set up a tapir transform that parses the `transaction` property from\n    // the response JSON.\n    var parse = json('transactions.*');\n    var url = MONDO_API_URL + '/transactions?account_id=' + config.accountId;\n\n    // optional config to set an end date for the transactions\n    if (config.before) {\n        url = url + '&before=' + config.before;\n    }\n\n    // optional config to set a start date for the transactions\n    if (config.since) {\n        url = url + '&since=' + config.since;\n    }\n\n    // optional config to hydrate the `merchant` property in each transaction\n    if (config.fetchMerchantDetails) {\n        url = url + '&expand[]=merchant';\n    }\n\n    // set up the oAuth 2.0 Header.\n    var options = {\n        headers: {\n            Authorization: 'Bearer ' + config.accessToken\n        }\n    };\n\n    // expose a composed method to execute the request and transform\n    // the resulted json into a tapir stream of transaction objects\n    return parse(http(url, options));\n}\n\nexports.create = create;\n\nNice! The code is pretty straightforward, as all the heavy-lifting is done by Tapir. Having said that, there's a couple of things to highlight:\n\nWe set up the transform for the json (in the var parse) inside the scope of the create function. This is important as the internal buffer for the transform needs to be scoped to the function.\n\nBy exposing a create property on the exports, the Tapir framework knows that we are expecting it to supply the bundle config to the exported function. This is a convention across Tapir, so bear it in mind whenever you need runtime config in your sources, transforms or destinations.\n\n\nTesting our Source\nA really nice way to test HTTP sources is using the nock http mocking and expectations library. Nock allows us to set up expectations for the exact format of the outgoing request, as well as specify a dummy response.\nIn the tests below we're using tape, a very lightweight TAP-compliant testing library that we can execute from the command line.\nIf you're coding along with this tutorial, make sure to:\nLet's look at some code that does the initial test suite setup: \n'use strict';\n\nconst transactions = require('../lib/transactions');\nconst MONDO_API_URL = 'https://api.getmondo.co.uk:443';\n\nconst jsonResponse = require('./fixtures/transactions.json');\n\nconst test = require('tape');\n\nconst nock = require('nock');\nnock.disableNetConnect();\n\nconst XMLHttpRequest = require('xhr2').XMLHttpRequest;\nglobal.XMLHttpRequest = XMLHttpRequest;\n\n\nNote that in the tests above we rely on the xhr2 module. This is because we're executing our tests in node, and there's no window object. Tapir's http module uses window.XMLHttpRequest under the hood so we use xhr2 here and hang it off the global object whilst the tests run.\nIf you're coding along with this tutorial, make sure to npm install nock tape xhr2 --save-dev to install these dev dependencies.\n\nHere's our first test:\ntest('creates a function when passed config', assert => {\n    const config = {};\n    const source = transactions.create(config);\n\n    assert.equal(typeof source, 'function', 'should create function');\n    assert.end();\n});\n\nThis is pretty much a self-explanatory smoke test.\nOther things we should test in this suite are:\n\nAppending the expected request parameters to the Monzo api call, based on the supplied Config\nMaking sure we add in the oAuth header \nChecking that we parse the transactions out of the JSON response\n\nLet's look at testing the config's effect on the api call next:\ntest('calls the mondo api transactions endpoint with the account id', assert => {\n    const config = {\n        accountId: 'accountId'\n    };\n\n    const scope = nock(MONDO_API_URL, { encodedQueryParams : true })\n        .get('/transactions')\n        .query({ account_id: config.accountId })\n        .reply(200, jsonResponse);\n\n    const source = transactions.create(config);\n\n    source(null, (end, data) => {\n        assert.true(scope.isDone(), 'request made');\n        assert.end();\n    });\n});\n\ntest('calls the mondo api transactions endpoint with the before date', assert => {\n    const config = {\n        accountId: 'accountId',\n        before: '2016-08-01T23:00:00Z'\n    };\n\n    const scope = nock(MONDO_API_URL, { encodedQueryParams : true })\n        .get('/transactions')\n        .query({\n            account_id: config.accountId,\n            before: config.before\n        })\n        .reply(200, jsonResponse);\n\n    const source = transactions.create(config);\n\n    source(null, (end, data) => {\n        assert.true(scope.isDone(), 'request made');\n        assert.end();\n    });\n});\n\ntest('calls the mondo api transactions endpoint with the since date', assert => {\n    const config = {\n        accountId: 'accountId',\n        since: '2016-08-01T23:00:00Z'\n    };\n\n    const scope = nock(MONDO_API_URL, { encodedQueryParams : true })\n        .get('/transactions')\n        .query({\n            account_id: config.accountId,\n            since: config.since\n        })\n        .reply(200, jsonResponse);\n\n    const source = transactions.create(config);\n\n    source(null, (end, data) => {\n        assert.true(scope.isDone(), 'request made');\n        assert.end();\n    });\n});\n\ntest('expands merchants if config specifies', assert => {\n    const config = {\n        accountId: 'accountId',\n        since: '2016-08-01T23:00:00Z',\n        fetchMerchantDetails: true\n    };\n\n    const scope = nock(MONDO_API_URL, { encodedQueryParams : true })\n        .get('/transactions')\n        .query({\n            account_id: config.accountId,\n            since: config.since,\n            expand: ['merchant']\n        })\n        .reply(200, jsonResponse);\n\n    const source = transactions.create(config);\n\n    source(null, (end, data) => {\n        assert.true(scope.isDone(), 'request made');\n        assert.end();\n    });\n});\n\nNext let's test we added the oAuth header from the config:\ntest('calls the mondo api transactions endpoint with the oauth token header', assert => {\n    const config = {\n        accountId: 'accountId',\n        accessToken: 'coole-token'\n    };\n\n    const scope = nock(MONDO_API_URL, { encodedQueryParams : true })\n        .matchHeader('Authorization', 'Bearer ' + config.accessToken)\n        .get('/transactions')\n        .query({\n            account_id: config.accountId\n        })\n        .reply(200, jsonResponse);\n\n    const source = transactions.create(config);\n\n    source(null, (end, data) => {\n        assert.true(scope.isDone(), 'request made');\n        assert.end();\n    });\n});\n\nFinally, lets' add a test to ensure we parsed the transaction objects out of the response JSON:\ntest('returns parsed Monzo transaction objects', assert => {\n    const config = {\n        accountId: 'accountId'\n    };\n\n    const scope = nock(MONDO_API_URL, { encodedQueryParams : true })\n        .get('/transactions')\n        .query({\n            account_id: config.accountId\n        })\n        .reply(200, jsonResponse);\n\n    const source = transactions.create(config);\n\n    source(null, (end, data) => {\n        const expected = jsonResponse.transactions[0];\n        const actual = data;\n\n        assert.true(scope.isDone(), 'request made');\n        assert.equal(actual, data, 'responded with JSON');\n\n        assert.end();\n    });\n\nGreat! Now we have a completed Tapir Source that's ready to use in our bundles.\n\nRemember you can clone the tutorial repo at https://github.com/vizia/monzo-tapir\n\n"},"tapir-tutorial/3-creating-a-destination.html":{"url":"tapir-tutorial/3-creating-a-destination.html","title":"Creating a Destination","keywords":"","body":"Vizia's Tapir framework comes with a whole bunch of destinations out of the box, but for the purposes of this tutorial we'll roll our own.\nOur two apps both require two-dimensional charts:\n\nThe cumulative spend app requires a line chart\nThe categories spending app requires stacked bars\n\nBoth charts have fairly similar requirements in that they're displaying typical two dimensional data. With this in mind we'll use Plotly.js to do the heavy lifting.\nSo, let's dive in and create a Tapir Destination with Plotly.

Let's break down what's happening.\nFirstly, we want to display our data in the DOM, so we choose to extend Tapir's DOM destination, overriding its init and onData methods.\nIn the init method, we set this.layout, based on some sensible defaults (defined in layoutDefaults), merged with any options passed in to the destination as config.\nIn the onData method things are a touch more complicated. The module has been designed so that the data it uses is typical plotly XY data, as shown below:\n[{\n  name: 'series name',\n  x: ['2016-09-01', '2016-09-02', '2016-09-03']\n  y: [1, 20, 10]\n},{\n  ...\n}]\n\nWe can assume that consumers of the destination we're building can use transforms to massage the data into this format (in fact we'll do this later in this tutorial sequence), but it seems reasonable to keep the Plotly-specific work inside this module, so we need to map over the incoming data here:\nvar seriesType = opts.seriesType || 'line';\nvar series = data.map(function (d) {\n    return Object.assign(d, {type: seriesType});\n});\n\nHere we add the seriesType property required by Plotly to each provided series that we need to display. We default to the line type, but the bundle config can override this.\nFinally, as per the Tapir docs, we need to call done() in the onData method to signal that we're ready.\nThat's it! We've built a very simple destination using Plotly.js\n\nRemember you can clone the tutorial repo at https://github.com/vizia/monzo-tapir\n\n"},"tapir-tutorial/4-transforming-our-data.html":{"url":"tapir-tutorial/4-transforming-our-data.html","title":"Transforming our Data","keywords":"","body":"So far in this tutorial, we've:\n\nCreated a source to pull data from Monzo bank's transactions API\nCreated a destination to chart two-dimensional data\n\nIn this part of the tutorial we'll look at creating transforms, which are small modules that reshape the data as it travels from the source to the destination.\nLet's concentrate on the transforms we need for our first app, the app that displays cumulative daily spending.\nWe know that our source simply lists any transactions between two specific points in time, and we know that our destination expects data in a specific format. So, we can deduce that we need to transform the data as follows:\n\nFilter the data so that we only show spending (ie remove account credits)\nGroup the data by day, and reduce over each day to calculate the sum of spending for that day, added to the previous day.\nTransform the final aggregated data into the format required by the destination\n\nWe can do this with three transforms chained together:\n\nA custom filter transform that removes items that are credits\nA concat transform from the tapir library that collapses the stream of transactions into one large array\nA final custom transform that performs the aggregation and massages the data into the format our destination requires.\n\nLet's have a look at the two custom transforms:\n'use strict';\n\nvar filter = require('@vizia/tapir/transforms/filter');\n\nmodule.exports = filter(function (item) {\n    return item.amount \nThat's a very simple transform!

In our case, we're interested in data where amount is less than zero, as positive amounts in Monzo's api indicate an account credit.\nNext up let's look at the final transform to aggregate the data:\n'use strict';\n\nvar createDatesArray = require('make-dates-array');\n\nexports.create = function (config) {\n    return function (data) {\n        // createDatesArray just creates an array of dates between since and            // before in YYYY-MM-DD format\n        var dates = createDatesArray(config.since, config.before);\n\n        // transaction.created is an ISO date string\n        // so truncate it to YYYY-MM-DD\n        var totalsByDay = data.reduce(function (memo, transaction) {\n\n            var dateStr = transaction.created.slice(0,10);\n            var amount = Math.abs(transaction.amount / 100);\n\n            memo[dateStr] = (memo[dateStr] || 0) + amount;\n\n            return memo;\n        }, {});\n\n        return [{\n            name: 'total',\n            x: dates,\n            y: dates.reduce(function(memo, date, idx){\n                var dateStr = getDateKey(date);\n                var total = totalsByDay[dateStr] || 0;\n\n                memo[idx] = total += (idx === 0 ? 0 : memo[idx - 1]);\n                return memo;\n            }, [])\n        }];\n    };\n};\n\nThere's a bit more going on here. The code is pretty self explanatory, but there's a couple of things we should highlight:\n\nThis transform exports an object with a create property. As we saw in the initial part of this tutorial when we created the source module, exposing a create property from a module lets Tapir know that this module needs bundle-level config. We use this config here to understand the date range that we're working with.\n\nWe want to reduce over all of the data supplied from the source in one go in order to perform our aggregation, so we can't chain this transform right off the back of the removeCreditsFilter transform. We need to use a Tapir concat transform to collapse the stream from the source. We can discuss this further in the next part of this tutorial series.\n\n\n\nRemember you can clone the tutorial repo at https://github.com/vizia/monzo-tapir\n\n"},"tapir-tutorial/5-putting-the-pieces-together.html":{"url":"tapir-tutorial/5-putting-the-pieces-together.html","title":"Putting the Pieces Together","keywords":"","body":"So far in this tutorial, we've:\n\nCreated a source to pull data from Monzo bank's transactions API\nCreated a destination to chart two-dimensional data\nCreated transforms to shape the data from the source into the format we want.\n\nThe next step is to put all the pieces together and create our finished bundle. The bundle essentially takes each piece we've created, defines some config, and stitches it all together into something Vizia can consume as a scene.\nLet's look at the main bundle code:\n'use strict';\n\nvar concat = require('@vizia/tapir/transforms/concat');\nvar monzoTransactions = require('monzo-transactions-source');\nvar removeCreditsFilter = require('./transforms/removeCreditsFilter');\nvar toDailyTotals = require('./transforms/toDailyTotals');\nvar xyChartDestination = require('vizia-plotly-xy-chart-destination');\n\nmodule.exports = function createBundle(tapir) {\n    var bundle = tapir();\n\n    bundle.use(monzoTransactions);\n    bundle.use(removeCreditsFilter);\n    bundle.use(concat);\n    bundle.use(toDailyTotals);\n\n    bundle.use(xyChartDestination);\n\n    return bundle;\n};\n\nNice and simple! There's a couple of things to highlight, as ever:\n\nWe use the dependency injection pattern to pass the tapir library in. As we shall see later on, this makes testing much simpler as we can stub/mock tapir.\n\nbundle.use tells Tapir to add a module to the pipeline. The order is important. The first call will be interpreted as a source.\n\n\nWe also need an entry point for our app, so we can easily run it whilst we develop it:\n'use strict';\n\nvar tapir = require('@vizia/tapir/bundle');\nvar bundle = require('./bundle')(tapir);\n\nbundle.set('destTarget', '#chart');\n\nvar config = {\n    accountId: '[our monzo account id]',\n    userId: '[our monzo user id]',\n    since: '2016-09-01T00:00:00Z', // start date for the visualisation\n    before: '2016-09-14T00:00:00Z', // end date for the visualisation\n    accessToken: '[our monzo oAuth token]'\n};\n\nbundle.load(config);\n\nbundle.start();\n\nWhen we're running inside Vizia, the config object will be supplied by Vizia itself, but this is a convenient pattern for development outside of Vizia.\nAdditionally, when we're running in Vizia, the DOM element will be supplied to our bundle automatically, but here we need to specify an element ourselves with bundle.set\nNote also that we require tapir here instead of in bundle.js and inject it as a dependency of bundle.\n\nRemember you can clone the tutorial repo at https://github.com/vizia/monzo-tapir\n\n"},"tapir-tutorial/6-testing-a-complete-bundle.html":{"url":"tapir-tutorial/6-testing-a-complete-bundle.html","title":"Testing a Complete Bundle","keywords":"","body":"So far in this tutorial, we've:\n\nCreated a source to pull data from Monzo bank's transactions API\nCreated a destination to chart two-dimensional data\nCreated transforms to shape the data from the source into the format we want.\nWeaved everything together into a complete bundle\n\nIn this step we'll look at some of the helpers that Tapir provides in order for us to test how our transformation chain works.\nHere's the test code for our bundle:\n'use strict';\n\nconst test = require('tape');\nconst sinon = require('sinon');\n\nconst tapir = require('@vizia/tapir/bundle');\nconst makeDownstream = require('@vizia/tapir/testHelpers/makeDownstream');\n\nconst jsdom = require('jsdom').jsdom;\nconst doc = jsdom(undefined);\nglobal.window = doc.defaultView;\nglobal.document = doc;\n\ntest('the transform pipeline works as expected', assert => {\n    const bundle = require('../../bundles/cumulative-spend/bundle')(tapir);\n    const config = {\n        since: '2016-09-01T00:00:00Z',\n        before: '2016-09-03T00:00:00Z',\n    };\n    const transformedOutput = [];\n    const replacementDestination = makeDownstream(transformedOutput);\n\n    const dummyData = [{\n        id: 'tx_1234',\n        created: '2016-09-01T16:53:34.38Z',\n        amount: 10000,\n        category: 'mondo',\n        include_in_spending: false\n    }, {\n        id: 'tx_1235',\n        created: '2016-09-01T20:00:00Z',\n        amount: -1000,\n        category: 'shopping',\n        include_in_spending: true\n    }, {\n        id: 'tx_1236',\n        created: '2016-09-01T20:00:00Z',\n        amount: -1000,\n        category: 'holidays',\n        include_in_spending: true\n    }, {\n        id: 'tx_1237',\n        created: '2016-09-01T21:00:00Z',\n        amount: -1500,\n        category: 'shopping',\n        include_in_spending: true\n    }, {\n        id: 'tx_1238',\n        created: '2016-09-02T09:00:00Z',\n        amount: -1000,\n        category: 'eating_out',\n        include_in_spending: true\n    }];\n\n    const expectedOutput = [{\n        name: 'total',\n        x: [ '2016-09-01', '2016-09-02', '2016-09-03' ],\n        y: [ 35, 45, 45 ]\n    }];\n\n    bundle.testPipeline(config, dummyData, replacementDestination);\n\n    assert.deepEqual(transformedOutput, [expectedOutput]);\n    assert.end();\n});\n\nLet's look at the most important things to note.\nconst jsdom = require('jsdom').jsdom;\nconst doc = jsdom(undefined);\nglobal.window = doc.defaultView;\nglobal.document = doc;\n\nThe above code, at the start of our tests, exists in order to provide a fake DOM environment for our destination. We'll be executing the tests in node, using tape so we need to hang a fake window and document off the global object. This isn't great, but as we'll see shortly we dont use the DOM in our test anyway.\nconst bundle = require('../../bundles/cumulative-spend/bundle')(tapir);\nconst config = {\n    since: '2016-09-01T00:00:00Z',\n    before: '2016-09-03T00:00:00Z',\n};\nconst transformedOutput = [];\nconst replacementDestination = makeDownstream(transformedOutput);\n\nHere we start to set up our test, by requiring in the bundle and setting some dummy config. Then, importantly, we start to use Tapir's test helpers.\nWe define an empty array, transformedOutput, that will ultimately contain the output of our transformation pipeline, and then use the tapir makeDownstream module to create a new destination that we'll shortly use to replace the destination in our bundle.\nconst dummyData = [{\n    id: 'tx_1234',\n    created: '2016-09-01T16:53:34.38Z',\n    amount: 10000,\n    category: 'mondo',\n    include_in_spending: false\n}, {\n    id: 'tx_1235',\n    created: '2016-09-01T20:00:00Z',\n    amount: -1000,\n    category: 'shopping',\n    include_in_spending: true\n}, {\n    id: 'tx_1236',\n    created: '2016-09-01T20:00:00Z',\n    amount: -1000,\n    category: 'holidays',\n    include_in_spending: true\n}, {\n    id: 'tx_1237',\n    created: '2016-09-01T21:00:00Z',\n    amount: -1500,\n    category: 'shopping',\n    include_in_spending: true\n}, {\n    id: 'tx_1238',\n    created: '2016-09-02T09:00:00Z',\n    amount: -1000,\n    category: 'eating_out',\n    include_in_spending: true\n}];\n\nconst expectedOutput = [{\n    name: 'total',\n    x: [ '2016-09-01', '2016-09-02', '2016-09-03' ],\n    y: [ 35, 45, 45 ]\n}];\n\nAbove we set up some dummy data in const dummyData that mirrors the data we expect our source to emit.\nThen we define const expectedOutput with the data that we expect our transformation pipeline to emit, when supplied with dummyData.\nbundle.testPipeline(config, dummyData, replacementDestination);\n\nAbove we act on our test setup, using Tapir's testPipeline method. This is a non-destructive method call that will execute the transform pipeline defined in bundle.js but with the provided dummy data instead of our source, and with the makeDownstream test destination instead of our bundle's destination.\nassert.deepEqual(transformedOutput, [expectedOutput]);\\nassert.end();\n\nAbove we simply assert that the bundle took the dummy data and transformed it as expected. Note that expectedOutput should be encapsulated in an array in this case. This is because our destination expects an array of plotly series.\n\nRemember you can clone the tutorial repo at https://github.com/vizia/monzo-tapir\n\n"},"tapir-tutorial/7-reusing-code-to-make-a-second-bundle.html":{"url":"tapir-tutorial/7-reusing-code-to-make-a-second-bundle.html","title":"Reusing Code","keywords":"","body":"In the previous steps of the tutorial we completed our app bundle to show the cumulative daily spend from our Monzo bank account.
