# Adding and maintaining documentation

- clone the repo
- install Gitbook so you can use it easily from the command line with `npm install gitbook-cli -g`
- `npm install` to get the plugin we're using
- view your changes locally using `gitbook serve`
- once your changes are good to go, do `npm run build` to fix up the directory sturcture for Github Pages and check everything in
- PRs can be merged without explicit approval, provided there are also no explicit objections, just please give adequate time for anyone who may be interested to comment
