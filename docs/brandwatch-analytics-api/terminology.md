The following are terms that are commonly used by Brandwatch and its users to describe core operations of the Brandwatch Analytics platform.

* **Project** ​- A silo within a Brandwatch user’s account to contain all their searches, settings and configurations. Settings and configurations can often be shared across and applied to searches within the same Project.

* **Query** ​- A keyword-based search utilizing Boolean operators to scan for matching results across select social networks and publicly accessible open websites.

* **Channel** ​- A search for all results associated with a specific Twitter handle, Facebook or Instagram page.

* **Group** ​- A user-defined collection of Queries and Channels for the purpose of analyzing the aggregation of all the results returned by that set.

* **Mention** ​- A single article of content with a message by an author with corresponding metadata returned as a result to a Query or Channel search, such as a Tweet, Comment, Blog Post, Forum Message, News Article, Image or Video. The message of text within a Mention is the source that will be analyzed by the system. Referred to by other vendors as a "verbatim" or "document".

* **Tag** ​- A simple user-defined label that can be applied as metadata to a Mention.

* **Category** ​- A user-defined label that has one level of hierarchy associated with it, which can be applied as metadata to a Mention. A single Category will be comprised of one or multiple Subcategories. A Category must have at least one Subcategory.

* **Rule** ​- These allow you to automatically perform actions on mentions, both in the future and historically, based on searches and filters that you define. For example, you may set up a rule that automatically applies a tag with the name "Purchase" when the text of the Mention contains the phrase "I just bought".
